      <h2>About</h2>
      Hi, I'm Eliza. I was born and raised in Portland but spent the past several years living in New York City. For the past decade I've worked in film in Wardrobe and Art Department. I love to make things. I've decided to take a class in coding because I've always been interested in it and felt like self-directed learning wasn't working for me. I'm interested in interactive art and how coding can be used to create interactive experiences.

      I'm a classically trained pianist and have played in multiple bands over the years. I can play guitar as well, bass a little, and am currently learning drums. I spend too much money on records and DJ under the name Womb Service; currently I have a show on xray.fm every other Monday from 3pm to 4pm and often spin records around town.

      I earned my BFA in Intermedia at PNCA in 2008. My thesis project was a video installation. I feel proficient at illustration and photography but wish I knew animation and coding better.
